# AlertLight
---
Alertlight uses a Raspberry Pi, a relay board, 2-line LCD screen and 2-level light in order to alert the user of a alarm coming from a webhook listener. Information about the alarm can be configured to be displayed on the 2-line LCD display.

The code in this repository is configured to be used with Paessler PRTG Network Monitor to receive the sensor information and sensorid in the URL.
